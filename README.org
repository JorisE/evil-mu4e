* DEPRECATION WARNING 
evil-mu4e has been merged into evil-collection. See: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection.

* evil-mu4e.el
This package configures keybindings for mu4e that make sense for Evil users.

* Installation and use
** MELPA

The recommended method is to use MELPA via package.el (~M-x
package-install RET evil-mu4e RET~).

To setup the new bindings, add the following the Emacs initialization file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'evil-mu4e)
#+END_SRC

** Manual install

Evil and mu4e are both required.  After requiring those packages, the following
will setup the new key bindings for you.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/evil-mu4e.el")
(require 'evil-mu4e)
#+END_SRC

* Keybindings

The bindings that differ from normal mu4e bindings are listed below:
